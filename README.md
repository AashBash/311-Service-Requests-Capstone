# NYC 311 Service Requests Capstone Project

Welcome to my final capstone project for the Springboard Data Science Career Track. This project analyzes NYC 311 service request data to uncover trends in complaint types, agency performance, and geographic disparities â€” and builds a predictive model to identify complaints likely to face delays.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Understand trends in 311 complaint volumes and resolution times
- Highlight underserved areas and slow-performing agencies
- Provide actionable insights to help city officials improve service delivery

This project fits into a broader effort to use business intelligence tools to enhance urban governance, accountability, and resident satisfaction.
